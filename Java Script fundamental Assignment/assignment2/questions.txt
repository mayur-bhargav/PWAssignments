Operators in JavaScript are symbols that perform operations on operands. Operands can be
variables, values, or expressions. Operators are essential in prorammin because they allow us to manipulate
data and perform calculations#

Operators in JavaScript are cateorized based on their functionality into the followin roups:
1.Arithmetic Operators: These operators perform mathematical operations on operands. Operands can be
numbers or variables.
// Addition (+)
const sum = 1 + 2; // sum is now equal to 3
// Subtraction (-)
const difference = 10 - 5; // difference is now equal to 5
// Multiplication (*)
const product = 3 * 4; // product is now equal to 12
// Division (/)
const quotient = 12 / 3; // quotient is now equal to 4
// Exponentiation (**)
const power = 2 ** 3; // power is now equal to 8
// Modulo (%)
const remainder = 10 % 3; // remainder is now equal to 1

2) Assignment Operators:WThese operators assin values to variables:
// Assignment operator (=)
const myVariable = 10;
// Addition assignment operator (+=)
myVariable += 5; // myVariable is now equal to 15
// Subtraction assignment operator (-=)
myVariable -= 5; // myVariable is now equal to 10
// Multiplication assignment operator (*=)
myVariable *= 2; // myVariable is now equal to 20
// Division assignment operator (/=)
myVariable /= 2; // myVariable is now equal to 10
// Modulo assignment operator (%=)
myVariable %= 3; // myVariable is now equal to 1

3. Comparison Operators: These operators compare two values and return a Boolean value (true or false).
// Equal to (==)
const isEqual = 10 == 10; // isEqual is now equal to true
// Not equal to (!=)
const isNotEqual = 10 != 10; // isNotEqual is now equal to false
// Greater than (>)
const isGreaterThan = 10 > 5; // isGreaterThan is now equal to true
// Less than (<)
const isLessThan = 10 < 5; // isLessThan is now equal to false
// Greater than or equal to (>=)
const isGreaterThanOrEqual = 10 >= 10; // isGreaterThanOrEqual is now equal to
true
// Less than or equal to (<=)
const isLessThanOrEqual = 10 <= 5; // isLessThanOrEqual is now equal to false

4. Logical Operators: These operators perform logical operations on Boolean values.
// AND (&&)
const isAndTrue = true && true; // isAndTrue is now equal to true
const isAndFalse = true && false; // isAndFalse is now equal to false
// OR (||)
const isOrTrue = true || false; // isOrTrue is now equal to true
const isOrFalse = false || false; // isOrFalse is now equal to false
// NOT (!)
const isNotTrue = !true; // isNotTrue is now equal to false
const isNotFalse = !false; // isNotFalse is now equal to true

Q3. Differentiate between unary, and binary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

Operators in JavaScript are categorized based on the number of operands they requireq into the

following groups
Unary operatorso Unary operators operate on a single operand
Binary operatorso Binary operators operate on two operands.
Unary operators in JavaScript are:
+
*
/
%
==
===
!=
!==
>
<
>=
<=
&&
||

Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these
concepts important?

Precedence refers to the order in which operators are evaluated when multiple operators are present
in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are executed first. For example, in the expression 3 + 5 * 2,
multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+), so the multiplication is performed first

const result = 3 + 5 * 2; // The result will be 13, not 16 (if addition had
higher precedence)

Associativity refers to the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated. Some operators
associate left to right, meaning they are evaluated from left to right. Others associate right to left, meaning they
are evaluated from right to left.

const result = 10 + 5 + 2; // The result will be 17 (evaluated as (10 + 5) + 2)

Understanding precedence and associativity is important for severa2 reasonsa
± Understanding the order of precedence ensures that expressions are
evaluated correctly, preventing potential errors or unexpected results
± When working with complex expressions, knowing the precedence and associativity
allows developers to write code that behaves as intended, making it easier to reason about and maintain
± In case of unexpected results, knowing operator precedence and
associativity helps in debugging and identifying the root cause of issues
± Knowledge of precedence and associativity can be used to optimize code by avoiding
unnecessary parentheses and ensuring efficient computation.

Q5. Write a JavaScript program that calculates the simple interest using the formula Simple interest =
(principal * rate * time) / 100.

const principal = 1000
const rate = 5
const time = 2 // in years
const result = (principal * rate * time)/100
console.log("Simple Interest =", result)

Q6. Write a Javascript program to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula BMI = weight (kg)/
height * height.

const height = 160 // in cm
const weight = 55 // in kg
const BMI = weight/ height * height
console.log("BMI =", BMI)

Q7. Write a program in JavaScript to calculate the area of a circle given its radius value of 10. Use
appropriate arithmetic operators.

const radius = 10; // Radius of the circle
// Calculate the area of the circle: area = π * radius^2
const pi = Math.PI; // Approximate value of pi
const area = pi * Math.pow(radius, 2);
console.log("Area of the circle:", area);
